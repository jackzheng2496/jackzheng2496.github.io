<p>
Been running five days a week for the past three weeks now. Feeling pretty good.
Might try to increase my running distance once I find the run too easy.
<p>

<p>
put a little shampoo on my hands<br>
rub it on my scalp<br>
i feel like im washing a dog
<p>

<p>
rinse the shampoo off my head<br>
i close my eyes<br>
i open my eyes<br>
 i'm still in the bathroom, lucky<br>
<p>

<p>
sometimes i look things and i get a sense that everything is perfectly fine and that it shouldn't be any more or any less than what currently is.<br>
i'd like to label this as beauty.<br>
