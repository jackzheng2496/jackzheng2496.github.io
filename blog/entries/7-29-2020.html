First time running four days in a row in a long time. Feels pretty good. I think its actually more beneficial for me to run in the morning as opposed to running after work. Firstly because it is a lot less hot in the morning. Secondly, I get the benefits of exercise for a longer portion of the day. Lets make it five days in a row tomorrow!

Thanos is a good dog. He comes when I tell him to come and hes always very interested in getting head pats. What a good dog. Hes also very affectionate and even though he has a lot of fur, he loves getting hugs.

Dude eating ramen with hot chili oil is fire. Something about the additional flavors introduced by the MSG tastes mad good. It makes your tongue tingle a bit.

In one of the passage in the "On Virtues" chapter for Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche goes on a whole rant where he accuses the Europeans of his time of making women "dull" by treating women as men's equal. That honestly was so funny to me because when I take into consideration how unsuccessful his romantic life was (with women), it seemed like a sort of confession, a sort of justification for his impotence in that regard. He could not court women and so he describes them as separate type of human, a type that could not and should not be rationalize. And then he goes on to rant for 3-4 more pages about why women are not mens equal and that they should be kept, almost like a pet, as some flighty species underneath men.
