Using this to keep track of random thoughts i encounter throughout the day. Maybe I can learn to write better this way?

Anyway, today was a good day. My sister came over with her boyfriend and they brought their two dogs over. I like Thanos. He is big, fluffly, white, and he walk around clumsily with a big smile on his face. His actions put a big smile on my face. Definitely a good boy.

Second day of running in the morning before eating lunch. Now, I'm not sure if its because I bought and drank good (subjective, of course) cold brew, but my mood for the day was pretty neutral. Which I consider a good thing. I bought Grady's cold brew -- vanilla flavored.

My sister bought some dim sum and had some leftovers. I ate a pastry that had a flaky, almost croissant like crust on the outside with sweet roasted pork on the inside. That shit was fire. The combination of sweet and savory never ceases to excite my tastebuds.

Probably going to read, maybe continue my latest painting if I can find a good color scheme, and then call it a day.
